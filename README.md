EmoReflector Project

EmoReflector is a social robot designed to interact with the elderly people based on emotions. It is implemented by a robust emotion recognition module using deep-learning models (CNN, ANN, RNN)
and embeding the algorithm into a micro-controller, Raspberry Pi. The robot has a camera to capture facial videos, and the module classifies the emotions of the user into negative or non-negative emotions.
Based on the recognized emotions, if the emotions are classified negative, the robot will respond using an audio output.
